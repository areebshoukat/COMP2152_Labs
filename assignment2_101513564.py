    # Q3: What is the benefit of using @property and @target.setter?
    # Using @property and @target.setter lets the program control access to the target value
    # without exposing the private variable directly. This makes the code safer because we can
    # validate new values before saving them. In this program, the setter prevents an empty
    # target from being assigned by mistake.

# Q1: How does PortScanner reuse code from NetworkTool?
# PortScanner reuses code from NetworkTool by inheriting its target-related behavior instead of
# rewriting it. For example, PortScanner gets the constructor logic, the target property, and
# the target setter from NetworkTool. This makes the child class shorter and helps keep shared
# network tool logic in one place.

        # Without the try-except block, the program could crash when a socket error happens,
        # such as when the machine is unreachable or the connection fails unexpectedly. That
        # would stop the scan early and the rest of the ports would not be checked. The
        # try-except block keeps the scanner running and prints a helpful error message instead.

    # Q2: Why do we use threading instead of scanning one port at a time?
    # Threading lets the program scan many ports at the same time, which makes the scanner much
    # faster than checking them one by one. If 1024 ports were scanned sequentially, the program
    # could take a long time because each socket might wait for a timeout before moving on. Using
    # threads reduces that waiting time by overlapping the scans.

# Q5: New Feature Proposal
# One extra feature I would add is a filter that shows only web-related ports such as 80, 443,
# and 8080 after the scan finishes. I would use a list comprehension to create a smaller list
# from scan_results that only includes results whose port number matches a web service. This
# would make the output easier to read when the user only wants the most common website ports.
